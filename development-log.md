# GeoIP API Development Log

This document chronicles the step-by-step development of the GeoIP API project, showing how it was built using the Cursor Editor AI assistant.

## Initial Setup and Basic API

1. Created basic Express.js server with rate limiting using JSON file storage
2. Added mmdbinspect integration for GeoIP lookups
3. Implemented basic API key validation

## SQLite Integration

1. Replaced JSON storage with SQLite database
2. Added proper schema for rate limits table
3. Created database initialization and table creation
4. Implemented atomic operations using transactions
5. Added graceful shutdown handling

## API Key Management

1. Created admin CLI tool for managing API keys
2. Implemented command to generate new API keys
3. Added custom rate limits per API key
4. Created update command for modifying API keys

## IP Address Handling

1. Added IP parameter support to /look endpoint
2. Implemented IPv4 and IPv6 validation
3. Added proper handling of localhost addresses
4. Fixed IP address formatting for mmdbinspect

## Configuration Management

1. Centralized configuration in config.js
2. Moved rate limit constants to shared config
3. Standardized configuration across server and admin tool

## Database Schema

1. Created schema.sql for database structure
2. Added indexes for performance optimization
3. Included name field for API key identification
4. Added rate_limit field for per-key limits

## CLI Tool Enhancement

1. Created admin shell script wrapper
2. Added sample command for testing IPs
3. Implemented proper error handling
4. Added formatted console output

## Documentation

1. Created comprehensive README
2. Added installation instructions
3. Documented API key management
4. Included rate limiting details
5. Added mmdbinspect installation guide

## Project Structure

```

├── admin           # CLI tool wrapper
├── admin.js        # CLI tool implementation
├── config.js       # Shared configuration
├── schema.sql      # Database schema
├── server.js       # Main API server
├── README.md       # Documentation
└── .gitignore      # Git ignore rules
```

## Key Features

1. GeoIP lookup with mmdbinspect
2. Per-API-key rate limiting
3. SQLite database storage
4. CLI tool for administration
5. IPv4 and IPv6 support
6. Configurable rate limits
7. Proper error handling

## Technical Decisions

1. Used SQLite for:

   - Better concurrency handling
   - Atomic operations
   - Efficient cleanup
   - Data integrity

2. Implemented CLI tool for:

   - Easy API key management
   - Testing and validation
   - Administrative tasks

3. Centralized configuration for:
   - Consistent settings
   - Easier maintenance
   - Better code organization

## Testing Instructions

1. Database Setup:

```bash
sqlite3 rate-limits.db < schema.sql
```

2. Create API Key:

```bash
./admin new "Test API"
```

3. Test API:

```bash
curl -H "api-key: YOUR_KEY" "http://localhost:3000/look?ip=1.1.1.1"
```

## Notes

- This is a test project created to explore Cursor Editor AI capabilities
- Uses DB-IP City Lite database (free version)
- Not intended for production use
- Demonstrates AI-assisted development workflow
